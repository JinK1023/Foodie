I announced this business model, which has both a social enterprise model and a profit-seeking business model through AI Hackathon in Barrie.



The problem is that a lot of money is wasted in the food business.
Many food vendors are having trouble disposing of their food stocks outside of their peak hours. 
Due to the nature of food, the value drops rapidly over time after making, leading to a waste of resources as well as the loss of the company.

solution is ~ Use A.I. to predict slow-moving inventory in real-time and connect them to buyers


there are 3 peak sales time.
Most of the profit comes from this peak time.

and our solution is ~ Use real-time analytics to predict slow-moving inventory throughout the day, discount them, and push them into the slow sales zone

we Transform slow-moving inventory into actual sales done through our platform.
so the sales profit line change like this.

How is it possible?


 
We use AI to predict customer demand and sales to solve problems. 
It is a business model that can prevent waste of resources as well as benefit both sellers and users by quickly connecting customers before their products lose value.
Business solutions that everyone benefits are our strengths.
